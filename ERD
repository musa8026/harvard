Overview
1. Business Problem
The business problem is to successfully create a real estate product that will provide the best customer 
experience. “Continuous efforts to “disrupt” the multi-trillion real estate industry have been consistently 
failing. Simply reiterating the fact that there are tons of inefficiencies to be addressed is not sufficient. 
Instead, diving deeper into the reasons behind the current state of property market might be a useful 
mental exercise for real estate innovators, as it might help to find the right approach to the right 
stakeholders.” -workmobileEmpirically, successful products have one to three gamechanging features, dozens of features that 
neutralize showstoppers, and very few features that are distractions. 
2. Objectives
As a technical business consultant to local agents, our goal is to create the best customer experience 
with a scalable database that will give a technical edge in addition to game-changing features. Here 
customers are segmented into 3 categories as “Buyer, Seller and Realtor” and their pain points 
presented below :
REAL ESTATE
Buyer :
- Wants take longer, more research, ------Physiological
- Best option for mortgage, insurance, title, attorney, ----End to End Experience
- Pay the Least House Price
Seller
- Wants take shorter transaction time ----- Ibuyer or Client
- Buy (Upgrade, Downgrade) without Sell ---- End to End
- Sell House for Top Dollar, Pay the Lease Commission
Realtor
-- Earn the most commision preferably from both selling and buying.
– Provide the best experience via multiple selection to delight both buyers and sellers : Ibuyer -- Real 
Estate Firm Buy, Power Buyer -- Seller Buy without Selling, Buy with All Cash Offer, Rent with Option to 
Buy
3. Purpose of the Database
Create a Real Estate Database : In real estate data is everything. As a result a database that is scalable, 
efficient and effective is a must. Here our database will be coming from an open source and manually 
created data. This will enable our business to get the most accurate property sales, cost and customer 
data. We will initially create SALE_HISTORY, TAX_DETAILS, FLOODS, HIGHLIGHTS, PROPERTY, 
PROPERTY_CATEGORY, CRIME_IN_AREA, PROPERTY_TYPE, LOCATION, CITY, PUBLIC_TRANSPORT, 
COUNTRY and STATE data later to be incorporated additional information.
4. Description of the Data
These data represents 14 tables for real estate transaction in the US that are relational with each other 
via Primary and Foreign Keys. In the following section we highlighted how those data are related with 
each other on ERD diagram. Most frequently used function will be to additional data point for a better 
picture for buyers. We aim to provide more comprehensive information compared to Zillow, Redfin, 
Compass and Realtor.com. For example we added “HIGHLIGHTS” table data to inform customers in 
additional ways.
5. Identifying the Database
We will work with a Relational Database because we will mainly work with structured data that require 
high level of data integrity and should be ACID It will also provide indexing capabilities, which results in 
faster query response times and secure transactions. Finally, being a simple and flexible model that 
provides normalization, a SQL database – preferably MySql will be an effective solution to work with real 
estate data.

A gamechanger - People will want to buy your product because of this feature.
A showstopper - People won’t buy your product if you’re missing this feature, but adding it 
won’t generate demand.
A distraction - This feature will make no measurable impact on adoption.
6. Scope
We will initially focus on only buyers to narrow the scope (to be scaled later to seller and realtors when 
needed.) 
7. Scale
MySQL is among the monolithic databases with vertical scaling. With the CAP theorem the trade-off 
choice will be preferring “Consistency and Availability”. 
8. How the System Handle Growth
As we will be focusing on local data we would be able to handle scaling challenges via cluster or sharding 
proxy in terms of system design. We will go with MySQL knowing those limitations.
9. ERD Diagram and Schema
TABLES
Below are the tables we created for this database.
• SALE_HISTORY
• TAX_DETAILS
• FLOODS
• HIGHLIGHTS
• PROPERTY
• PROPERTY_CATEGORY
• CRIME_IN_AREA
• PROPERTY_TYPE
• LOCATION
• CITY
• PUBLIC_TRANSPORT
• COUNTRY
• STATE
Below is Crow’s Foot Notation to help understand how we designed our database via “Many”, “One and 
ONLY One”, “Zero or One”, “One or Many” and “Zero or Many”.
10. Business Queries
The website that our High Fidelity Design with my Database will look like this example below.
https://zerodown.com
There are many useful insight can be compiled via both manually and machine learning. However here 
for the sake of simplicity we focused on some simple queries to see if our tables have been set up 
properly. Below is the example code snippets and results :
Query 1:
--List of properties in New york city
SELECT
P.PropertyName,
P.NumberOfRooms,
P.NumberOfBathRooms,
P.NumberOfGarages,
P.NumberOfParkingSpaces,
P.Price,
L.StreetAddress,
C.CityName
FROM
property P INNER JOIN location L on P.LocationID=L.LocationID
LEFT JOIN city C on C.CityID=L.CityID
WHERE C.CityName='New York
Query 2:
--Total number of properties against every city in DB
SELECT
C.CityName,
COUNT(P.PropertyID) AS totalListedProperties
FROM
property P INNER JOIN location L on P.LocationID=L.LocationID
LEFT JOIN city C on C.CityID=L.CityID
GROUP BY C.CityName
Query 3:
--Higlights of property with the ID=1
SELECT
P.PropertyName,
P.Price,
H.HighlightTitle,
H.HighlightDescription
FROM property P INNER JOIN highlights H
on p.PropertyID=H.PropertyID
WHERE P.PropertyID=1
Query 4:
--Get all the schools which is near to any property
SELECT
P.PropertyName,
S.SchoolName,
S.DistanceFromProperty
FROM property P INNER JOIN school S
on P.PropertyID=S.PropertyID
Query 5:
--Get the list of properties with the type of Single-Family Home
SELECT
P.PropertyName,
P.Price,
P.NumberOfRooms,
P.NumberOfBathRooms,
P.NumberOfGarages,
PT.TypeName
FROM property P INNER JOIN property_type PT
on P.PropertyTypeID=PT.PropertyTypeID
WHERE PT.TypeName='Single-Family Home'
Query 6:
--Number of Listed properties W.R.T their type
SELECT
PT.TypeName,
COUNT(P.PropertyID) as ListProperties
FROM property P INNER JOIN property_type PT
on P.PropertyTypeID=PT.PropertyTypeID
GROUP BY PT.TypeName
Query 7:
--How many crimes happened near to each property
SELECT
P.PropertyName,
COUNT(ca.CrimeRecordID) as crimeCount
FROM property P INNER JOIN crime_in_area ca
on P.PropertyTypeID=ca.PropertyID
GROUP BY P.PropertyName
Note : 
InnoDB is a storage engine that allow Foriegn Key, Rollback, commit and ACID Compliant.
CHARSET = is a set of characters that are legal in a string.
uft8mb4 means that each character is stored as a maximum of 4 bytes in the UTF-8 encoding scheme.
ai refers accent insensitivity
ci refers to case insensitivity.
COLLATE = set of rules used to compare characters
11. Code and Database
Code will be attached separately.
We used xampp-control App (XAMPP provides a Control Panel for efficient management of the 
software in the XAMPP package. You can use the Control Panel to determine whether Apache and 
MySQL are currently running and to start or stop them. Before you can use your development 
environment, Apache and MySQL must be running)

We create our database via highlighted yellow named “PropertyManagDB”
The we go to SQL tab and paste our code to create the schema and dump the data.
Here it shows that our database tables have been created.
